# Crafting SMART goals
The SMART goal must include three aligned components, presented as bullet points beneath the goal:

Leader Outcomes & Metrics

Specific leader actions (e.g., systems, monitoring, facilitation, feedback)

A measurable indicator of success

Actions that can realistically be influenced through the stated coaching time

Teacher Outcomes & Metrics

Observable instructional or planning behaviors teachers will demonstrate

Metrics tied to implementation quality, consistency, or use of district-aligned practices

Ensure expectations are reasonable given limited coaching access

Student Outcomes & Metrics

A focused student learning outcome directly connected to the teacher actions

Use progress monitoring, skill acquisition, or instructional exposure metrics, not broad achievement claims

Avoid unrealistic gains; prioritize directional improvement or early indicators of growth

Alignment Requirements

Leader actions should enable and support teacher actions

Teacher actions should directly drive student outcomes

All three levels must clearly connect to the same instructional priority

The goal should reflect systems-building, not one-off events

Constraints & Quality Guardrails

Do not propose outcomes that would require daily coaching or full implementation support

Do not overpromise student achievement gains beyond what is feasible

Prioritize clarity, coherence, and feasibility

Use precise, professional language suitable for district documentation

Output Format

Begin with the SMART goal statement (1–2 sentences)

Follow with clearly labeled bullets:
