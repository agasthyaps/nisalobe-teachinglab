# Examples of good teacher and student outcome metrics:

## Metrics - Observable Evidence of Success (Before Cycle)

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Teacher Metric:** | Teacher integrates at least 3 individual oral checks and 2 written checks per Fundations lesson (SP1/SP4) |
| **Teacher Metric:** | Teacher tracks individual student accuracy data weekly (once a week) and adjusts instruction accordingly. |
| **Student Metric: HQIM Progress Monitoring Tool (e.g., Fundations Checklist)** | 30%+ of Students respond individually during Fundations drills and letter formation tasks |
| **Student Metric: HQIM Progress Monitoring Tool (e.g., Fundations Checklist)** | 65%+ Students show accuracy growth in letter formation and sound identification across checks and 65%+ of students |

## Before

| Student Metric: HQIM Progress Monitoring Tool (e.g., Fundations Checklist) | 1 | 2 | 3 | TERI: Students regularly provide named models by explaining or showing their thinking in text. |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| (15 min) At least 2-3 students independently reference vocabulary in the target in discussion or during share-out. | (15 min) Two or more students independently use target vocabulary accurately during discussion or share-out, without teacher prompting. Students use the vocabulary to clarify ideas, explain reasoning, or connect back to the learning. | (15 min) One student independently uses target vocabulary during discussion/share-out, or 2–3 students use it only with teacher prompting. | (15 min) No students independently reference or engage with the learning target verbally or in writing. The student only answers when the teacher models it or it requires students to repeat it. | |

## After (w/ data tracker)

| Student Metric: HQIM Progress Monitoring Tool (e.g., Fundations Checklist) | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | How to measure whole class performance: | Usability of student progress data to the cycle: |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 70% of target students achieve level 3 or mastery of target, as noted in data tracker (row 5.1). | 3 The student has demonstrated a full and complete understanding of all practices essential to the target. | 2 The student has demonstrated a partial understanding of all content and practices essential to the target. | 1 The student has demonstrated merely an acquaintance with the content provided a completely accurate response. | How to measure whole class performance: • Score each student (3, 2, or 1) • Tally how many students scored at each level • Divide by total students. | Example: 17 out of 24 students score 4–3 = 70% of class meets benchmark. | Would need to collect and compare BOY/MOY and EOY work samples [bullet/written] to measure growth throughout a school year.
