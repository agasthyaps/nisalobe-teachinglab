## Teaching Lab CAP Knowledge Base

This knowledge base contains essential guidance for Teaching Lab's Coaching Action Plan (CAP) system. Reference this consistently when supporting coaches with CAP-related questions, troubleshooting, or process clarification.

### Navigate
- `capoverview.md`: Conceptual overview of CAP structure, purpose, and quality exemplars
- `CAPguide.md`: Complete reference guide for CAP creation, naming, storage, and authorization
- `updates.md`: Chronological updates including fixes, FAQs, and system changes

### Contents

#### **capoverview.md**
Foundational document explaining what CAPs are, how they should be used, and what quality entries look like.

**Key use cases:**
- Coach or staff member is new to CAPs and needs foundational understanding
- Coach asks "what should I write in [Area of Focus/Metrics/Session Notes]?"
- Coach needs examples of high-quality CAP entries
- Explaining the difference between coaching moves, sessions, and cycles
- Clarifying what makes metrics observable and measurable
- Teaching someone how to document coaching impact effectively

#### **CAPguide.md**
Core reference document covering CAP system fundamentals (naming conventions, example sheets, auth, etc).

**Key use cases:**
- Coach asks how to name a new CAP
- Coach needs to troubleshoot authorization issues
- Coach is unclear about file storage location
- Coach has questions about group vs. individual CAP setup

#### **updates.md**
Bi-weekly "This Month in CAP-Land" newsletter archive with ongoing fixes, finds, and FAQs.

**Key use cases:**
- Coach reports dropdown validation errors (punctuation issue)
- Coach asks about recent changes to group coaching process
- Coach needs examples of well-written CAP sections
- Coach asks about micro-PL logging or specific edge cases

### Usage Guidelines

When coaches ask CAP-related questions:
1. For conceptual or "what/how" questions: Start with `capoverview.md` to establish foundational understanding
2. For recent changes or known issues: Check `updates.md` for current clarifications and workarounds
3. For procedural/technical setup: Reference `CAPguide.md` for naming, storage, and authorization processes
4. Always cite specific sections when providing guidance

### Quick Answers

#### CAP naming conventions, making a new CAP

Please **copy** from the [**master survey input**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11jlo9UeWxZGwunhDb24hZBwAKc5b8ZKM9AYNWZaUyZY/edit?gid=2037785111#gid=2037785111), and note that any misspellings will lead to data invalidity/unusability. Do **NOT** put additional information such as P.S. 109\_Emma Smith\_ELA. Just 109, as shown in the is all that should be included: 109\_Emma Smith\_ELA.

Use this [**tool**](https://tl-data.teachinglab.org/cap_naming_validator/) to check your work: “Enter a CAP file name here, to see if it is correctly formatted\!”

### Exemplar Entry
#### Exemplar: Area of Focus
**What makes it strong:**
- Uses **concrete, quantified evidence** (e.g., "0 of 12 students verbalized during writing tasks")
- Clearly **names the gap** in observable terms
- Explains **why it matters** by connecting to instructional decision-making or student learning
- Makes the problem of practice **unmistakable** to any reader

**Example structure:**
> "During independent writing, 0 of 12 students verbalized their thinking when prompted. This limits the teacher's ability to formatively assess student understanding and make in-the-moment instructional adjustments. By increasing individual student 'at-bats' for verbalization, the teacher will gather more accurate data on student mastery and be able to differentiate support accordingly."

### Exemplar: Metrics - Observable Evidence of Impact

**Teacher Metrics - What makes them strong:**
- Identify **specific actions** (e.g., "tracks accuracy data weekly")
- Name **evidence sources** (e.g., "oral checks during guided practice, written exit tickets")
- Specify **frequency** (weekly, daily, per lesson)

**Example:**
> "Teacher will collect and analyze student accuracy data weekly using oral comprehension checks during guided reading and written responses on exit tickets."

**Student Metrics - What makes them strong:**
- **Quantify expectations** (e.g., "65%+ of students demonstrate accuracy")
- Name the **tool or method** used to measure (e.g., "as measured by weekly quiz scores")
- Describe **observable student behavior** or outcome

**Example:**
> "65%+ of students will demonstrate accuracy in identifying text evidence to support inferences, as measured by weekly reading response tasks."

### Exemplar: Session Documentation - Rationale

**What makes it strong:**
- Tells the **story** of your coaching impact
- Connects **coaching actions** → **teacher actions** → **student outcomes**
- Explains the **logic** behind metric ratings
- Specific enough that another coach could understand the progression

**Example structure:**
> "I modeled how to use a think-aloud during shared reading, then co-taught a lesson where the teacher practiced this move with half the class. Students responded with 8/12 verbalizing their thinking (up from 0/12 baseline), demonstrating immediate impact. Teacher will continue practicing think-alouds during all shared reading lessons this week, with admin observing one lesson to provide reinforcement feedback."
