### Quick Answers

#### CAP naming conventions, making a new CAP

Please **copy** from the [**master survey input**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11jlo9UeWxZGwunhDb24hZBwAKc5b8ZKM9AYNWZaUyZY/edit?gid=2037785111#gid=2037785111), and note that any misspellings will lead to data invalidity/unusability. Do **NOT** put additional information such as P.S. 109\_Emma Smith\_ELA. Just 109, as shown in the is all that should be included: 109\_Emma Smith\_ELA.

Use this [**tool**](https://tl-data.teachinglab.org/cap_naming_validator/) to check your work: “Enter a CAP file name here, to see if it is correctly formatted\!”

| Coaching Model | Naming Convention | Force Copy Link |
| :---: | ----- | :---: |
| **1 to 1 Coaching** | School Name\_Teacher First and Last Name\_Subject **Example 1:** 211\_Duncan Gates\_Math **Example 2:** Chippens Hill Middle School\_Shaye Worthman\_ELA **Example 3:** KIPP KC Elementary School\_Ching Sullivan\_Math | [**FY26 CAP**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1w60qxFFIxTp3WSJdtLOj8HFMelifa2hxekh01nzORlg/copy) \*BEST PRACTICE\* ALWAYS MAKE A COPY FROM HERE \- THE SOURCE. This is the best way to ensure all updates are reflected in your CAP. |
| **Group Coaching** | School Name\_Group \#\_Subject *\*group numbers will be assigned in the monday participant roster\**  **Example 1:** 211\_Group 1\_Math **Example 2:** Chippens Hill Middle School\_Group 2\_ELA **Example 3:** KIPP KC Elementary School\_Group 3\_Math |  |

Once the Teacher CAP dashboards are operating, we could begin the process again for this different model.* |

### Exemplar Entry
#### Exemplar: Area of Focus
**What makes it strong:**
- Uses **concrete, quantified evidence** (e.g., "0 of 12 students verbalized during writing tasks")
- Clearly **names the gap** in observable terms
- Explains **why it matters** by connecting to instructional decision-making or student learning
- Makes the problem of practice **unmistakable** to any reader

**Example structure:**
> "During independent writing, 0 of 12 students verbalized their thinking when prompted. This limits the teacher's ability to formatively assess student understanding and make in-the-moment instructional adjustments. By increasing individual student 'at-bats' for verbalization, the teacher will gather more accurate data on student mastery and be able to differentiate support accordingly."
