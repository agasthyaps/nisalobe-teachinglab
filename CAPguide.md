This newsletter shares systemwide guidance, clarifications, and common questions that apply across projects.

2. # 💬 **Individualized Questions:**    Before submitting a new question, please review this FAQ [document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kWRpAE1zGyTqSpzq-NkdRF_-qPBsw1mpI9H3XNJmUjo/edit?resourcekey=&gid=1194274255#gid=1194274255), which compiles individual questions that have already been asked and answered. If you don’t see your question there or need tailored support, please submit your question [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfXLz__kD-xmNYnGXU1JOa0_sxAssqfPgNp7-NfTuseuoKOSw/viewform?usp=sharing&ouid=104915953606704566550).

   

# **Naming your CAPs**

Please **copy** from the [**master survey input**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11jlo9UeWxZGwunhDb24hZBwAKc5b8ZKM9AYNWZaUyZY/edit?gid=2037785111#gid=2037785111), and note that any misspellings will lead to data invalidity/unusability. Do **NOT** put additional information such as P.S. 109\_Emma Smith\_ELA. Just 109, as shown in the [master survey input](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11jlo9UeWxZGwunhDb24hZBwAKc5b8ZKM9AYNWZaUyZY/edit?gid=2037785111#gid=2037785111) is all that should be included: 109\_Emma Smith\_ELA.

Use this [**tool**](https://tl-data.teachinglab.org/cap_naming_validator/) to check your work: “Enter a CAP file name here, to see if it is correctly formatted\!”

# **Storing your CAPs**

Here is the file organization:  
[*Shared Drives*](https://drive.google.com/drive/shared-drives) *\> [Teaching Lab Sitework Hub](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0ANN3z_FPFoCCUk9PVA) \> [**FY26 Coaching Action Plans**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FKz7Crr0L8BiCwY30shOHhgwJARHnQwG?usp=drive_link) \> Subject \> District Folder \> Coach Folder*

Move your CAPs into your Coach Folder in the district(s) you support.

These folders are automatically created based on the [**staffing match board.**](https://teachinglab.monday.com/boards/6902955796) If your name is not in the folder, check to see if you are appropriately assigned in this board. Reach out to your CPM if not. 

# **Authorizing your CAP**

There are a few initial steps that must be followed in order for your CAP to “talk” to the necessary documents/viewers. You must do this **once** initially, or potentially twice to update the data if your teacher has not yet been added to the roster at the time of creation of the CAP in question.

[**Click here to see the step-by-step guide.**](https://scribehow.com/viewer/Making_a_Copy__Authorizing_Scripts__6peEjE8ERVKpj_MNzEs3uA)

Or if a quick summary works for you…

1. Make the copy.  
2. Wait for an “Admin” dropdown to appear in the Google Docs toolbar.  
3. Click each of the 2 items in that dropdown.  
4. To update the list of teachers at any given time, click Admin \-\> Update

# **Things to Remember**

In order for Teaching Lab to successfully extract data from these CAPs, please keep the following in mind:

* Name the file as outlined [**above**]().   
* Name each tab as you see modeled in the template. **Cycle 1, Cycle 2**, etc. Feel free to add other tabs as resources \- they will not register when we analyze data.   
* For **group coaching**,   
  * Coaches should continue to create one CAP for the full group of teachers they support. To ensure all teachers are properly linked to that CAP on the backend, please follow the new [Group Coaching Rostering and CAPs Process](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_7cnaHBnYBnan3wKCcvQJcg6CLbDWAygaK0NjziQ_ws/edit?tab=t.0) outlined by our L\&R team.  
  * For group coaching, please record average data across classrooms for the metrics section.  
* Please do not change the layout of this sheet (additional columns or tabs). If so, our CAP dashboard will be looking for information in the ***wrong*** places.   
* This CAP plan is meant to be used for either **one teacher**, or **one group of teachers**, across all of their cycles. Teachers with different goals should have different CAPs. 

All projects that have teacher or leader coaching, regardless of the cadence of coaching, should use the CAP. Coaches should work with their Coach Developer to determine the ideal number of coaching cycles for the project given the frequency of coaching.

# **Do you have \>6 Sessions**

1. Create a new tab by clicking the “+” in the lower left hand corner of your current CAP   
2. Name this new tab “Cycle X Additional Sessions”, X being whatever the current cycle is  
3. Copy and paste [this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nPi2Q75k99WF20tpTvfZNqE33JMNgG5Hi0Jlw-DId0Y/edit?gid=0#gid=0) into the tab you just created  
4. Delete sessions that are not needed.   
   1. If you have 8 total sessions this means that you will **delete 4** sessions from the new tab, corresponding to columns H:O, and leaving **2 sessions** for data entry in your new tab.  
5. Note that none of these actions should affect your main “Cycle X” sheet.  
6. See [this zoom clip re-enactment](https://us02web.zoom.us/clips/share/ji7PBLNMTc6-ZbEyX4pOZA) if you need more help.
